Crypto framework is answerable for encoding the client's information and give a protected system to store it in a virtual drive. This virtual drive will be made by the framework for the specific client for the absolute first while utilizing the framework. This framework will give restricted capacity region where the information can be saved. As we can say that it's a distributed storage medium where information can be gotten to from any area. This framework will likewise empower you to synchronize your work area or PC while utilizing this crypto framework. 

For carrying out security instrument, every client's ought to have a legitimate login id and secret key and the confirmation of client's record will be done through their substantial email id. Upon getting to this crypto framework, clients can essentially move their archives from their framework to their virtual hard drive where it will require some investment for scrambling the reports and cycle of encryption and unscrambling will rely on the size of record and their sort. Easy to understand interface has been given, with the goal that clients can undoubtedly get to every one of the given highlights. It utilizes solid cycle encryption system and its virtual hard drive and handily stacked and dumped at any area according to the client's decision.
